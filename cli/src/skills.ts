 * Exported because `doctor` must check exactly the paths `installSkills` writes. When these lived
 * inline in the install routine, the only way to verify an install was to re-derive the layout —
 * and a second copy of a path table drifts.
 *
 * `other` and `antigravity` both use `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — the Agent Skills layout
 * read by Antigravity, Codex and other non-Claude, non-Cursor, non-Windsurf tools. Claude Code,
 * Cursor and Windsurf each have their own native location as their PRIMARY path, and additionally
 * get a symlink at this same `.agents/skills/...` path (see `writeOrLink`) so any tool that reads
 * the standard location finds the skill regardless of which tool actually installed it.
 *
 * `claude-code`/`other`/`antigravity` are folder-capable, so their `pointer-feedback` entry is
 * followed by its three sub-files (`apply.md`, `translate.md`, `advanced.md`) as siblings of
 * `SKILL.md` — `writeOrLink` writes those, this table just documents (and lets `doctor`/`update`
 * check) the paths. `cursor`/`windsurf` have no folder for siblings, so their `pointer-feedback`
 * entry stays a single flat file that CONTAINS all four sections (see `buildFlatPointerFeedback`).
