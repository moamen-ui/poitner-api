/**
 * The Vite plugin, exercised through the BUILT bundle, in a plain `node` process.
 *
 * Both halves of that sentence are load-bearing.
 *
 * Built, because every other test here runs from TypeScript source, and source and bundle resolve
 * CJS/ESM interop differently. The plugin loads @babel/traverse and @babel/generator through that
 * interop. In the bundle they resolved to objects rather than functions, so every file threw; the
 * plugin caught it (it must never break a host build), warned once per file, and wrote an EMPTY
 * manifest. The source-stamp feature did nothing in every shipped copy of the CLI while this suite
 * stayed green.
 *
 * In a plain node process, because `npm test` runs through tsx — and tsx re-transforms the
 * imported bundle, restoring the very interop this is meant to check. Loading dist/ from inside a
 * tsx-hosted test passes whether the bug is present or not: verified by reintroducing it and
 * watching the test still pass. So the assertion runs in a child `node`, and this test only reads
 * its verdict.
